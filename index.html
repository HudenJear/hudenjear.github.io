  <ttl style="font-weight: bold;">Hello, this is Huden Jear broadcasting! </ttl>

  <p>Happy to see you here and glad you found this website.</p>
  
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Self introduction: </p>
  
  <p>My name is ZHENG GONG, also known as Huden Jear. I`m now working as an algorithm engineer in Shenzhen, China. I am also trying to find a PhD position majoring in deep learning and its applications. I develop CV and NLP models to analyze medical images, particularly focusing on eye retinal and OCT images, and genetics during my graduate study and work. Collaborating closely with doctors and researchers, I contribute to the entire research process, from data pre-processing and registering to developing and optimizing models that address specific clinical and technical challenges. I also write academic papers based on the findings. </p>

  <p> </p>
  
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">During my graduate and work period, my researches are mainly about: </p>
  
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">1. IQA: image quality assessment</p>
  <p> Image quality plays a crucial role in medical record quality control. Therefore, we should develop an image quality assessment algorithm specifically for medical images. </p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">2. Cataract image restoration</p>
  <p> Seeing through the cloudy lenses of cataract patients, ophthalmologists can diagnose whether these patients have other highly blinding eye diseases. Consequently, an image restoration method was specifically developed for cataract images.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">3. RNA optimization</p>
  <p> The mysterious RNA sequences hold significant potential for various applications. RNA vaccines and industrial protein manufacturing processes can leverage RNA optimization techniques to achieve higher protein expression rates. In my research, I pioneered a novel RNA optimization method that combines deep learning with unique loss functions, resulting in a multi-factor optimized mRNA coding sequence (CDS).  </p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">4. Other Projects:</p>
  <p> (1)Pathologic Myopia screening; (2)Fundus tumor segmentation; (3) LLM for medical records; (4) Blured fundus image restoration; (5)Optical aixs length prediction for OCT images. </p>

  <p style="font-weight: bold;">I am also a photographer. I use films to take photos with my Hasselblad 500cm and Olympus OM30. Here are some samples of the photos I took:</p>
