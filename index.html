  <ttl style="font-weight: bold;">Hello, this is Huden Jear broadcasting! </ttl>

  <p>Happy to see you here and glad you found this website.</p>
  
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Self introduction: </p>
  
  <p>My name is ZHENG GONG, also known as Huden Jear. I`m now working as an algorithm engineer in Shenzhen, China. But I am also trying to find a PhD position majoring in deep learning and its applications. I develop CV and NLP models to analyze medical images, particularly focusing on eye retinal and OCT images, and genetics. Collaborating closely with doctors and researchers, I contribute to the entire research process, from data pre-processing and registering to developing and optimizing models that address specific clinical and technical challenges. I also write academic papers based on the findings. </p>


  
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">During my graduate and work period, my researches are mainly about: </p>
  
  <p>1. IQA: image quality assessment</p>
  <p>2. Cataract image restoration</p>
  <p>3. RNA optimization</p>
  <p>4. Pathologic Myopia screening</p>
